# Cryptographic Libraries Comparison

This project aims to compare and contrast two modern cryptographic libraries, PyNaCl and Tink, and their usage in real-world scenarios. It implements various cryptographic operations and evaluates the features, ease of use, and limitations of each library.

## Introduction

The Cryptographic Libraries Comparison project focuses on evaluating the functionality and usage of PyNaCl and Tink. It explores key generation, encryption, decryption, signature operations, and MAC operations using both libraries. The project aims to provide insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and practical considerations.

## Installation
